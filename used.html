    The Range Rover is a 4x4 luxury SUV produced by Land Rover1. It was <br>

    Range Rover Evoque, and Range Rover Velar12. The Range Rover has been <br>
    the SUV of choice for celebrities and wealthy <br>elites for decades,
     but it still offers off-road capability that means<br> it can venture well off the red carpet3.

    The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular<br>
    Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, which <br>featured a black ring bearing the
     company name surrounding the company logo,<br> an image of a horse head on a plinth.
     BMW retained Rapp's black ring <br>inscribed with the company name, but the interior
      of the ring is quartered blue and white<br> reminiscent of the coat of arms and flag 
      of Bavaria (which in turn are based on the arms of the historic<br> House of Wittelsbach, 
      which ruled Bavaria for many centuries).<br>The logo does not bear the distinctive lozenge
       shape found on the coat of arms, however,<br> as local laws at 
    the time it was introduced <br>forbade the use of state coats of arms on commercial logo
